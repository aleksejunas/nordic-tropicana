##### Welcome to Nordic Tropicana's system for keeping track of and growing bananas 🍌 and pineapples 🍍 in greenhouses in Norway.

It's a project set in the year 2035 (Yeah! You heard right. IN THE FUTURE!)
The climate has changed and Norway is now a great place to grow pineapples 🍍
and bananas 🍌 in greenhouses in Norway.

It's a system for monitoring and taking care of the plants, by monitoring light,
temperature and humidity. It's based on the ESP32-S3 Microcontroller, which has onboard
senors for all these things. But the temperature and humidty is measured using the external
DHT11 sensor
